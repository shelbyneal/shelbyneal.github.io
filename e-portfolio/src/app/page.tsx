While I am very serious when it comes to getting my work done, I also find a lot of enjoyment in traveling and creative expression. As a side note, I have absolutely no idea how to dance; however, I have no reservations when it comes to diving head first into something new. I look forward to diving head first into many new projects in the near future!"
